# Mise En Place

## Layer sorting based on what you see

I got tired of arranging the layer list to sort artboards the way I like em. So
I wrote this little plug-in. Press `CTRL OPTION COMMAND L` to make the layer list
reflect the order you see in the canvas.

## Get ready for Principle

Whenever I need to work on Principle, I spend some time tweaking layer names in
Sketch before importing artboards. But now, I press `CTRL OPTION COMMAND P` and
all symbol instances get detached and renamed on a duplicated page that's ready
for Principle.
